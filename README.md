## Tools
The <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank"> Go</a> programming language was installed on Windows, version 1.24.0.

The Go extension was installed in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank"> VS Code</a>, version 0.46.1.

The program <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download" target="_blank" > Insomnia</a> was used to simulate route requests.
