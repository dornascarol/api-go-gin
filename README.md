## Tools
The <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank"> Go</a> programming language was installed on Windows, version 1.24.0.

The Go extension was installed in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank"> VS Code</a>, version 0.46.1.

The program <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download" target="_blank" > Insomnia</a> was used to simulate route requests.

The container management tool <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" target="_blank" > Docker Desktop</a> was installed, using the version compatible with the operating system.


## Running the project

1. **To get the repository, clone it:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/dornascarol/api-go-gin.git
	cd api-go-gin
	```

2. **Command to check, update, and download the package manager modules (go.mod):**
	```
	go mod tidy
	```

3. **Command to run the project in the terminal:**
	```
	go run main.go
	```

4. **To stop the execution in the terminal: press `"Ctrl"` + `"C"`.**
<br>  

### _Docker_

1. **Command to run the `docker-compose.yml` file with two service images, one for Postgres and another for pgAdmin:**
	```
	docker-compose up
	```

_Another way to run Docker_

1. **To find out the full name of the containers, write the command in the terminal:**
	```
	docker ps -a
	```
  
2. **To run the containers, write the next command in the terminal:**
	```
	docker start gin-api-rest-pgadmin-compose-1 gin-api-rest-postgres-1 redis-cache
	```
  
3. **Stop the containers with the command in the terminal:**
	```
	docker stop gin-api-rest-pgadmin-compose-1 gin-api-rest-postgres-1 redis-cache
	```

- URL to access pgAdmin:
```
localhost:54321
```
<br>  

### _Tests_

1. **To run the tests simultaneously:**
   ```
   go test -v ./...
   ```

_Another way to run Tests_

1. **To run tests individually with more detailed outputs:**
	```
	go test -run TestFailed -v
	```

	```
	go test -run TestGreetingStatusCode -v
	```

 	```
	go test -run TestAllSingersHandler -v
	```

  	```
	go test -run TestSearchSingerByNameHandler -v
	```

   	```
	go test -run TestSearchSingerByIdHandler -v
	```

	```
 	go test -run TestDeleteSingerHandler -v
   	```

 	```
	go test -run TestEditSingerHandler -v
  	```
    
 
_Importing package testify/assert_

1. **Command:**
	```
	go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert@v1.10.0
	```
